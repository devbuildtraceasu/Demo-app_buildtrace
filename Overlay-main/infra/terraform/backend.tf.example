# Terraform Backend Configuration
# Copy this to backend.tf and update with your bucket name

terraform {
  backend "gcs" {
    bucket = "buildtrace-terraform-state"  # Update if you used a different name
    prefix = "terraform/state"
  }
}

# Note: If you can't create the bucket, you can comment out the backend block
# and Terraform will use local state (stored in terraform.tfstate file)
# This is NOT recommended for production but works for testing
