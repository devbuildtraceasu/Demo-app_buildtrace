# Technical Tasks

- [ ]  Build Frontend
    - [ ]  Design the frontend (AZ)
    - [ ]  Link the replit frontend with the Review app’s frontend
    - [ ]  Clarify which parts are not needed for full buildout, which parts are needed
        - [ ]  **Fake part** (for simple demo purpose)**:**
            - [ ]  At the “Try it on one project”, the project details can be as it is (we have a placeholder). We should have an example files already existed in the DB for processing as an alternative.
            - [ ]  All existing project placeholders should still be there as it is.
            - [ ]  The cost & Schedule impact format is great, the data has to be changed to a real project example from our result (TBD)
            - [ ]  Settings and Credits can stay as it is
        - [ ]  **Real part**:
            - [ ]  The overlay review panel should look like the “Review app”;
            - [ ]  Manual Align should be optimized into a working solution.
            - [ ]  Drawing panel should contain our existing drawing example that we are using for the example run
            - [ ]  At the “New comparison” part, we shall make it real to upload real drawing sets and keep the existing drawing set the example we have.
    - [ ]  Replicate the https://replit.com/@az167/Build-TraceFlow UI.
- [ ]  Build Cloud architecture
    - [ ]  Components (Major Ones→ Rest are encapsulated around it )
        - [ ]  Storage:  GCS, Postgres(+ pgvector)
        - [ ]  Deployments: Cloud Run, Artifact Registry
        - [ ]  Message Queues: PubSub
        - [ ]  Identity Management: IAM
        - [ ]  Monitoring : Cloud Monitoring(Billing , Infra components)
- [ ]  Backend
    - [ ]  **Make SIFT alignment the first choice(threshold) →** give another option(buttons) → if that doesn’t work then use grid alignment (change the current sequence)→ Verifier or check(why not a vlm call)?
        - [ ]  if SIFT works → overlay generated:
        else:
           use GridLine
        Generate Overlay
    - [ ]  Flask or FastAPI (Currently using uv but limited scaling).

AI Analysis step:

1. Analyze each sheet (for each revision)
    1. read legends
    2. read general notes
    3. Understand what this sheet is
2. Throw in overlay (old, new, overlay)
    1. read red and green to see the difference
    2. analyze each changes
    3. map those changes into trades
    4. give a ROM on cost and schedule impact
    5. Mark the biggest cost driver in this
3. For the newly added drawings from the new set
    1. from the previous analysis in step 1, estimate the cost and schedule for building them out.
