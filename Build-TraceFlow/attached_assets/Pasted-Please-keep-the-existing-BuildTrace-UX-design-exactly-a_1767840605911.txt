Please keep the existing BuildTrace UX design exactly as-is unless explicitly changed below.
Apply these focused fixes and additions:

1. Make the user profile clickable with full account controls

In the top bar, the user avatar / name must open a Profile & Account menu and page.

Profile menu (dropdown from avatar) should include:
– View profile
– Account & billing
– Organization / team
– Sign out

Profile page contents:
– Editable fields: name, job title, company, phone
– User permissions / role: e.g. Admin, Member, Viewer (only Admin can change roles)
– “Invite teammates” section with:
• Invite by email input
• Role selector for invitee
– “Chat history” section:
• List of past AI chats or sessions associated with this user
• Simple table: date, project, last message snippet, “Open” button

The design should show where these live in the layout and what the key interactions are (edit, save, invite, change role, open chat).

2. Upgrade the comparison panel with Overlay + Side-by-side and full change editing

In the comparison / overlay view, keep the current structure but add:

a) View mode toggles
At the top of the drawing viewer, add clear toggle buttons:
– “Overlay”
– “Side-by-side”

b) Overlay visual rules
In Overlay mode, the drawing visualization should follow this legend:
– Red: elements that exist in the old drawing but not in the new one (removed / changed parts)
– Green: elements that exist in the new drawing but not in the old one (new / changed parts)
– Grey: areas with no changes (context / unchanged geometry)
Include a small legend in the UI explaining these three colors.

c) Change list interaction
The right-hand change list should behave like this:
– Clicking on a change row zooms and highlights the corresponding region on the drawing.
– Each change row shows: description, sheet ID, discipline, cost impact tag, schedule tag, and status.
– Allowed status values:
• Open
• In review
• Pricing
• Closed
– The user can edit: description, tags, and status, then click Save.

d) Create new changes directly on the drawing
In the drawing viewer, add a tool (e.g. “Add change”) that allows:
– The user to draw/snap a new bounding box region on the overlay.
– After drawing the box, a new change entry pops up:
• Auto-fills sheet ID and coordinates
• User can add description, cost/schedule notes, status
– Saving this creates a new row in the change list and keeps it linked to that region.

e) Side-by-side mode
– Left panel: old drawing
– Right panel: new drawing
– Synchronized pan/zoom
– Clicking a change in the list still highlights the correct region in both views.

3. Add an Organization “god mode” for internal BuildTrace team

Add an Organization or Admin view (accessible only to Admin / internal BuildTrace roles) that provides a “god mode” overview.

This view should include:

a) User management table
– Columns: User name, email, organization, role, last login, number of projects, status (active / suspended)
– Ability to:
• Change user role
• Deactivate / suspend a user

b) Activity / uploads overview
– Table or cards showing:
• Project name
• Owner (user)
• Number of drawing sets uploaded
• Last comparison run date
– Clicking into a project opens that project dashboard.

c) Drawing & data management
– For each project, an “Assets” tab where an admin can:
• See all uploaded drawing sets
• Delete individual drawing sets or entire projects
– Include confirmation states for destructive actions (delete drawings / project).

This is meant as an internal control center, not visible to normal end users.

4. Clarify the overlay result legend (repeat and emphasize)

Everywhere the overlay visualization appears, ensure the legend is consistent and clearly visible:
– Red: old, removed or changed parts
– Green: new or modified parts in the latest drawing
– Grey: unchanged background context

The legend should be present on the main comparison screen and on any exported-view mockups you include.

5. Add a Credits panel under Account → Settings

Under Settings (for the logged-in user/account), add a main panel called Credits.

Business logic:
– In BuildTrace, 10 credits = $1.
– Credits are consumed when overlays and analyses are generated.

Credits panel layout should include:
– Current credit balance (large, clear number)
– Equivalent dollar value shown underneath (e.g. “2,000 credits ≈ $200”)
– Recent usage table with columns: Date, Project, Action (e.g. “Overlay + Analysis”), Credits used.
– A “Purchase credits” or “Top up” section:
• Predefined packs (e.g. 5,000 / 10,000 / 25,000 credits)
• Indicate approximate dollar cost for each pack based on 10 credits = $1.
• Primary CTA: “Buy credits” (you do not need to design the payment gateway itself, just the UX around selecting and confirming packs).

The rest of the Settings layout should remain the same; just add Credits as a prominent tab / section within Account.

Important:
– Do not redesign the rest of the app. Only implement the changes and new screens/sections described above.
– Keep visual style, navigation, and overall structure identical to your current BuildTrace design unless a change is explicitly requested here.
