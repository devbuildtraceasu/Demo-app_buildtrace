What I need you to design
Please design the UX for these key surfaces:

1. Marketing landing page
A minimal, high-clarity page explaining the product in one glance.
• Strong headline
• Simple 3-step “How it works”
• CTA to try a project
• Trust strip with customer logos or quotes
• Footer with basic links

2. Onboarding / First project setup
A guided, low-friction flow that collects only essential info:
Step 1: Project basics (name, type, budget range, location)
Step 2: Upload drawings (previous set and revised set)
Step 3: Select disciplines and optional filters (sheet range, search by sheet ID)
Step 4: Summary screen + “Run comparison”
Show a slim progress indicator and clear microcopy.

3. Authenticated workspace layout
A simple, powerful structure:
• Left navigation: Projects, Overlays, Change Reports, Cost & Schedule, Settings
• Top bar: active project selector, notifications, user menu
• Clean content area for each view

4. Project dashboard
A high-level project overview:
• Project metadata
• Timeline of drawing revisions with badges showing impacted sheets
• Recent comparison runs and their status
• CTA to start a new comparison

5. Overlay / Comparison viewer (core experience)
This is the main “aha moment.”
• Split layout
– Left: drawing viewer with overlay or side-by-side mode
– Right: structured change list with grouping and filters
• Features:
– Toggle layers (new, removed, modified)
– Pan/zoom
– Jump to change location from the list
– Filters by discipline, sheet, severity, status

6. Cost & Schedule insights view
Clear, decision-ready summaries:
• Total cost delta
• Cost impact by trade
• Schedule impact by phase
• Charts or simplified visuals
• Export to PDF or CSV

7. Collaboration tools
Lightweight review workflow:
• Comment on individual changes
• Assign changes to specific team members
• Status options: Open, In Review, Pricing Needed, Closed

Deliverables to output

Do not write code. Focus entirely on UX structure, flows, hierarchy, and clarity.
